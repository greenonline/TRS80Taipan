# TRS80Taipan
Source code (BASIC) and cassette media

Massaging the [original BASIC source code](https://taipangame.com/BASIC.txt) from [Taipan!](https://taipangame.com) into formats that are more user friendly for either:
- copying and pasting the BASIC as text into an emulator (in my case `sdltrs` on OS X);
- loading from a cassette file
- loading from a floppy disk file (TBA)
- loading from a hard disk file (TBA)

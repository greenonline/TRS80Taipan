# !!!NOT!!! TRS80Taipan
## Hi-Res Apple II version of Taipan
### An analysis

Source code (BASIC) and cassette media

Massaging the [original BASIC source code](https://taipangame.com/BASIC.txt) from [Taipan!](https://taipangame.com) into formats that are more user friendly for either:
- copying and pasting the BASIC as text into an emulator (in my case `sdltrs` and **VirtualII** on OS X);
- loading from a cassette file
- loading from a floppy disk file (TBA)
- loading from a hard disk file (TBA)

This reprository contains:
 - A set of scripts to do the massaging.
 - A considerable number of hacks and mods to the BASIC code:
   - To add new features:
     - "Records"
     - "Parley" 
     - Additional data logging
   - To make a self-playing game
 - A breakdown of the code - including CALLS, POKEs, PEEKs and USR statements.
 - Some media (cassette/disk) containing the code
